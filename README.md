### ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I'm Toby Ang  
And I'm a 17-year-old learning programmer and hobbyist aspiring to use my God-given skills for His kingdom.

### Languages
My main languages are HTML, CSS, JS, and Python. I've also learned a bit of Node, React, Django, Java, C++, and WebGL.
I mainly use Python for [Project Euler](https://github.com/tang0226/projectEuler).

I love to experiment with math and computer science. I enjoy fractals, digital logic, Project Euler, cellular automata, the chaos game, emergent behavior, neural networks, and vanilla coding in TI-Basic.

### Projects
* [Fracture](https://github.com/tang0226/fracture): an escape-time fractal viewer built with HTML Canvas and a lot of frontend Javascript. The app is hosted via Github pages at [tang0226.github.io](https://tang0226.github.io/fracture/src/main).
* [NNJS](https://github.com/tang0226/nnjs): a bare-bones implementation of a feed-forward neural network tested with survival-of-the-fittest training on a basic flappy-bird game.
* [Kaprekar](https://github.com/tang0226/kaprekar): a canvas visualization of fractal patterns resulting from the [Kaprekar Routine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar%27s_routine). Similar to escape-time fractals, each point on the canvas represents a number in some base, colored based on the number of iterations before the Kaprekar Routine starts repeating. Fractals really are everywhere!
* [Other HTML canvas projects](https://github.com/tang0226/canvas-projects): various simulations, screensavers, and experiments I've built as I've been learning canvas.
