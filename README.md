### ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I'm Toby Ang  
And I'm a learning programmer and hobbyist aspiring to use my God-given skills for His kingdom.

#### Languages
I've learned HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as a bit of React and Django.
I also use Python for [Project Euler](https://github.com/tang0226/projectEuler).  
  
#### Projects
My only large project so far has been [Fracture](https://github.com/tang0226/fracture), my fractal viewer built with HTML Canvas and a lot of frontend Javascript. The app is hosted via Github pages at [tang0226.github.io](https://tang0226.github.io/fracture/src/main). You can learn more in the project README.
